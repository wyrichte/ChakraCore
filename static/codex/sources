# The old yvals.h header (usually pulled in through <new>) is missing a pop pragma which caused
# the below errors to be suppressed by accident.  The new yvals.h header fixes this so these warnings
# are now errors in this project.  To maintain pre-existing behavior these warnings are disabled; you
# are encouraged to remove the /wd entries and fix the warnings in your code.
