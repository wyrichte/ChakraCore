<DIV ID=Introduction>
	We have found that there is great value in having certain information
 	logged along with every change that we make to the code base.   To
	insure uniformity here, the following form leads you the process.
</DIV>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<DL>
<DIV ID=Title_helpSec>
<A NAME=Title_help> <DT> <B> Title </B> (required) </DT> 
<DD>
    A one line summary of the submission.
</DD>
</DL>
</A>
</DIV>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<DL>
<DIV ID=Bugs_fixed_helpSec>
<A NAME=Bugs_fixed_help> <DT> <B> Bugs Fixed </B> </DT>
<DD>
   	The checkin automation can resolve bugs automatically when a submission
    is checked in.   By clicking on 'Find My Fixed Bugs' you can populate the
    form with the Fix Available, Fix Tested or Fix Queued bugs that are 
    currently assigned to you.  Alternatively, you can also enter the bug
    numbers manually as a comma separated list.
    <P> 
    The checkin system will only resolve bugs if the 'opened build' field
	of the bugs is the VBL that it checks into (e.g. Lab21S).  It does this
    because a bug should not be resolved until the change has been integrated
    into the VBL where the bug was originally found.   
</DD>
</DL>
</A>
</DIV>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<DL>
<DIV ID=Issue_description_helpSec>
<A NAME=Issue_description_help> <DT> <B> Issue Description (required except bug fixes) </B></DT>
<DD>
    A description of reason why the change was needed. 
    Do not include descriptions in the 'Find My Fixed Bugs' table as 
    they will be included automatically.  Bug numbers entered manually
	do need to be described, as only the bug number is available and
    not the description. 
</DD>
</DL>
</A>
</DIV>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<DL>
<DIV ID=Change_description_helpSec>
<A NAME=Change_description_help> <DT> <B> Change Description </B></DT>
<DD>
    A high level description (a sentence to several paragraphs) of the 
    modifications to the code base that were needed to resolve the issue(s).  
	If there were several viable options for fixing something, documenting why
    you chose the one you did is very valuable.  If the fix is trivial or
	you have described the issue in product studio, then this field is optional.

</DIV>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<DL>
<DIV ID=Risk_helpSec>
<A NAME=Risk_help> <DT> <B> Risk </B></DT>
<DD>
    A measure of how risky a fix is.
    <DL>
    <DT> Low <B>(SafeToMerge)</B></DT>
    <DD>
		You would bet $100 that you will never see a break caused by this change.
        If breaks should happen, this checkin is unlikely to be the culprit.
        <B>So low risk jobs are assumed to be mergeable in SNAP</B>.
    </DD>
    <DT> Medium </DT>
    <DD>
        You believe that the change is small and unlikely to cause a break.
        Nevertheless, if a break does happen, this checkin should not be
        ruled out as a possible culprit.
    </DD>
    <DT> High </DT>
    <DD>
        You have done what testing you can, but the change is large and/or the
        ramifications are the fix are subtle and you could imagine breaking 
        something.  You should detail the risk in the Test Impact section.

    All Checkins should have run through the battery of tests and builds 
    that the dailyDevRun automation does (see
	<A HREF='http://mswikis/clr/dev/Pages/Running%20Tests.aspx' TARGET=BLANK> New User Doc </A>).
	This field indicates when this was done, and any anomalies that where 
    discovered during that run.  This field is typically filled in automatically
	by the form software.
	<P>
	Fixes that need fast turnaround time may not have done a dailyDevRun.
	In this case, indicate that in this field as well as the reason why.

    You should also run <A HREF='http://mswikis/clr/dev/Pages/Running%20Macintosh%20Tests.aspx' TARGET=BLANK>DailyDevRun automation on a Mac</A>,

    All changes to the product must be reviews by one or more developers before
    being submitted.  This field is the e-mail alias of the developer who
    did the review.  
	If your update is not to the product, you can enter
    'Not Needed' (however a code review is strongly encouraged even in this case).

    In line with "Feature Crew" concept, all checkins must be accompanied by test review. 
	A member of the Test team must review the change to provide feedback from a test perspective.

    If your update is not to the product, you can enter 'Not Needed'.

<DD>
</DD>
    To avoid security flaws, we have a special review that looks just for
    changes that might open security hole (e.g. buffer overruns, design flaws, etc). 
    Each feature area has been assigned a set of security reviewers.  Go
    to the <A TARGET=_blank HREF='http://teams/sites/clrdev/Lists/Security%20Reviewers%20list/AllItems.aspx'>
	Security Reviewer list</A> on the <A TARGET=_blank HREF='http://teams/sites/clrdev/default.aspx'>
	CLR Developers Site </A> for details.

    This field is the e-mail alias of the developer who did the security review. 
    This cannot be the same as the main Code Reviewer even if she is the best person
    to do the Security review. You do need to have a second pair of eyes take a look 
    at the changes. Please email <A HREF='mailto:ClrSecCR'>ClrSecCr</A> for clarifications.
    <P>
    If your update is not to the product, you can enter 'Not Needed'.
